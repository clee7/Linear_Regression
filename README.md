# Linear_Regression
This MatLab code simulates linear regression algorithm for classification. We choose 100 points as the training set and a random target line. Linear regression algorithm is used in finding a solution to classify the points. A in-sample error is calculated using this solution. We then use 1000 test points to calculate the out-of-sample error. These two errors are then compared.
